\section{Definition and Comparison to Stream Ciphers}

In symmetric cryptography, block ciphers and stream ciphers are two main types~\cite{Paar2024}.

Stream ciphers encrypt data one bit or one byte at a time. They use a \textit{keystream}, where each keystream bit is added to a plaintext bit individually~\cite{Paar2024}.

Block ciphers process fixed-size blocks of data, with each block encrypted separately~\cite{Paar2024}.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Block Cipher} & \textbf{Stream Cipher} \\
\hline
Encrypts chunks (blocks) & Encrypts continuously, bit by bit \\
\hline
Offers more security when used properly & Can be faster and have less delay \\
