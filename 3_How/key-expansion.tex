\subsection{Key Expansion}

\subsubsection*{Importance of Key Expansion in AES} 

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) heavily relies on the key expansion (or key schedule), 
a process that derives a series of round keys from the initial cipher key. 
This process ensures that each round uses a different key, 
greatly increasing the cipher's security. The key expansion process slightly differs 
based on the AES version (AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256), mainly in the number of rounds 
and the size of the key.

\subsubsection*{Key Size and Security}

The key size directly impacts the security level of the algorithm, with 
longer keys providing higher security against brute force attacks. AES-128 offers sufficient security 
for most applications, but AES-192 and AES-256 are often preferred for applications requiring 
long-term security or protecting highly sensitive data. The increased number of rounds in AES-256 
further enhances its resistance against advanced cryptanalytic techniques.
