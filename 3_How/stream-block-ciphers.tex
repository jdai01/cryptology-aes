\subsection{Stream and block ciphers}

Stream ciphers encrypt data one bit or one byte at a time.
They use a keystream, where each keystream bit is added to the plaintext individually \cite{Paar2024}.
An example would be the Caesar cipher, which substitutes one character with another individually.

Block ciphers process fixed-size blocks of data, with each block encrypted separatel \cite{Paar2024}.

Stream ciphers are faster and more efficient than block ciphers as they encrypt one bit of data at a time rather than the entire blocks. 
Block ciphers can offer stronger security over stream ciphers, depending on its use \cite{Paar2024}.
