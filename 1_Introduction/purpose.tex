\subsection{Purpose of the paper}

The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of \gls{AES}, one of the most widly adopted encryption algorithms used to secure digital data.
The paper aims to explain the fundamental reasons for \gls{AES}'s development, the security challenges it addresses, and how it achieves strong encryption through its structured operations. 
By examining the internal workings of \gls{AES}, which includes its key expansion, substitution, permutation, and mixing steps, this paper seeks to demystify the encryption and decryption processes.
Furthermore, it explores the underlying mathematical principles that make \gls{AES} secure and resilient against cryptography attacks.
To reinforce understanding, the paper also includes simplified examples demonstrating how AES operates in practice.
