\subsection{\textsc{AddRoundKey} transformation}
\label{sec:AddRoundKey}

The \textsc{AddRoundKey} transformation combines the current state matrix with a round key derived from the key expansion process (Section \ref{sec:key-expansion}). 

This transformation operates by performing a bitwise \texttt{XOR} operation between each byte of the state matrix and the corresponding byte of the round key, represented as:
\begin{equation}
    C_{i,\text{out}} = C_{i,\text{in}} \oplus K_i
\end{equation}
where $ C_{i,\text{in}}$ and $C_{i,\text{out}}$ denote the input and output bytes of the state respectively, and $K_i$ represents the corresponding byte of the round key.

This step introduces key-dependent confusion into the encryption process, ensuring that the state is uniquely modified at each round based on the key material.
