\subsection{Limitations and considerations}

Despite its many strengths, using AES in practice has several important challenges that can affect security 
and effectiveness of cryptographic solutions.

\subparagraph{Key Management}

No symmetric cipher, including AES, can guarantee security if key management practices are poor. The entire 
method fundamentally depends on the secrecy, integrity, and lifecycle management of keys. Secure generation, 
distribution, rotation, storage (often using physical security modules), and destruction are critical.

Regardless of AES's mathematical strength, mistakes — such as using weak keys, allowing key reuse, failing to 
rotate compromised keys, or transmitting keys over insecure channels—can undermine the confidentiality of 
encrypted data.

\subparagraph{Implementation Vulnerabilities}

AES's theoretical resilience is not immune to practical attacks targeting its real-world implementation. 
Side-channel attacks—such as timing, cache, power consumption, or electromagnetic radiation analysis—can 
reveal key material if the implementation is not carefully handled. Mitigating these risks requires additional 
programming practices like constant-time implementations or mathematically secure curves.

\subparagraph{Lack of Built-In Authentication}
AES offers confidentiality, but it does not include a way to verify that the encrypted data hasn't been tampered 
with. Data integrity and authenticity must be added using MACs or by adopting combined authenticated encryption 
modes like GCM or CCM. Neglecting to supplement basic AES with integrity checks can expose the system to forgery 
and modification attacks.
