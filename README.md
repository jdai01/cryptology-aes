# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

This repository presents my research and implementation of the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** â€” one of the most widely used symmetric encryption algorithms in the world. 

The project delves into the **mathematical foundations** behind AES, including **finite field arithmetic**, **byte substitution**, **permutation**, and **key expansion**, followed by a **full implementation of AES-128 encryption**.
