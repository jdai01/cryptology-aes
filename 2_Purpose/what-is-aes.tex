\subsection{What is AES?}

\textbf{\Glsentrylong{AES} (\gls{AES})} is the successor to \gls{DES}, with the algorithm developed by Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daeman (herein defined as Rijndael algorithm). 
It is a symmetric block cipher that can process data blocks of 128 bits, using cipher keys with lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits \cite{NIST_AES}.
As the algorithm utilises different key lengths, they may be referred to ``\gls{AES}-128'', ``\gls{AES}-192'' and ``\gls{AES}-256'' based on their key length, with ``\gls{AES}-128'' being adopted as the standard. 
Collectively, they will be referred as ``the \gls{AES} algorithm''.
