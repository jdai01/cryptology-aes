\subsection{Possible Future Work}

Future work could focus on extending the current implementation to include AES-192 and AES-256, which would involve handling their respective key lengths and more complex key expansion procedures. 
Additionally, implementing the decryption process would provide a complete encryption-decryption cycle, enabling full functionality of the AES algorithm. 
Another potential enhancement is to allow input keys and plaintext data in formats other than hexadecimal, such as ASCII or binary, by incorporating automatic conversion methods. 
Finally, a comparative analysis of runtime complexity and execution time for encryption and decryption across AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 could provide valuable insights into the performance and efficiency trade-offs among these variants.
